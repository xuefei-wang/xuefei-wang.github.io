### The Problem

We studied the subgroup of auditory neurons found they are differently involved in perception and choice in the two alternative forced choice (2AFC) tasks, specifically **Cortical – Cortical (CC)** projecting neurons are more involved in sensory perception processing, while the responses of **Cortical – Subcortical (CS)** projecting neurons are more relevant to movement control. 

The **differences in information coding** could be explained by different possibilities: 

- they integrate information from different **sources**
- they integrate information with different integrating **mechanisms**
- or both

### The Approach

To test the first hypothesis, I conducted an independent experiment -- **rabies tracing**. 

To proﬁle brain-wide distributions of neurons directly presynaptic to the two groups of neurons, I used Cre-dependent tracing with G-deleted rabies virus (RVdG). To restrict initial RVdG infection to Cre expressing starter neurons in a given region and label monosynaptic input neurons speciﬁcally, we used Cre-dependent AAV vectors to express TVA and rabies glycoprotein (G) selectively in Cre+  neurons. TVA is a receptor for the avian sarcoma leucosis virus envelope protein, EnvA, and allows selective infection of Cre ‘‘starter’’ cells with EnvA-pseudotyped RVdG (EnvA+RVdG). Expression of G in Cre+ neurons allows for trans-complementation in neurons infected with RVdG such that rabies particles can be produced in starter cells and spread to their direct presynaptic inputs. 

For CS neurons, wildtype animals are used. Cav-cre, AAV-Flex-mCherry-TVA-2A-G are injected in superior colliculus, auditory cortex, respectively. Two weeks later, Rabies-dG-GFP-EnvA was injected in the same site in Auditory Cortex. For CC neurons, TLX-Cre mouse line used and the same injection is performed except the Cav-Cre.

### The Innovations and Discoveries

The preliminary result suggests that **CC** neurons receive input from **dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN)** , while CS neurons receive more input from structures implicated in **top-down** modulation of brain states.
