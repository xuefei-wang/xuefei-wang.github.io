Work: develop method, implement as Python package

Topic: ERP, temporal analysis, 



The fine **temporal resolution** of  EEG should give rich temporal information. But the information is submerged by **noise**. If it can be extracted and utilized, a complete profile of neural dynamics can be provided.

Based on the multivariate **topographic** analysis, I developed an analytical framework to explore neural dynamics in ERPs. The first method separates continuous ERP waveforms into distinct components based on their topographic patterns. Crucial **temporal indices** (peak latency, onset and offset times, processing speed) can be automatically identified. The second method scrutinizes the temporal dynamics of identified components by **reducing the temporal variance among trials**. This method quantifies the temporal variance as a new measure of cognitive noise, as well as increases both the accuracy of temporal dynamics estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ERP responses by aligning trials. 

The validity and reliability of these methods were **tested with empirical datasets** from an attention study and a semantic priming study. 

These methods are implemented in the Python-based open-source package [TTT](https://github.com/TTT-EEG/TTT-EEG) (Topography-based Temporal-analysis Toolbox). The [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/779546v1) can be found in Biorxiv.
