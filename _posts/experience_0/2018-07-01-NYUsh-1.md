### The Problem

Fine **temporal resolution** at millisecond-level grants EEG enormous advantages to probe the underlying neural dynamics of various cognitive functions . However, non-invasive scalp recordings are usually noisy. To improve SNR, neural signals are averaged across trials to reveal relatively stable dynamics. With random noise being averaged out, the remaining waveform is called the **Event-Related Potential** (ERP). One of the common ways to explore the neural dynamics in ERPs is to examine the neural response magnitude around certain peak latencies.

The well-established ERP analysis utilizes only a small portion of the **temporal information** from EEG recordings, namely the peak latencies. More temporal indices can provide a more complete picture of neural dynamics. 

### The Approach

To probe the temporal information in EEG recordings, I developed an analytical framework and implemented a Python-based open source package named [TTT](https://github.com/TTT-EEG/TTT-EEG) (Topography-based Temporal-analysis Toolbox). The manuscript is in submission and the preprint can be found in Biorxiv ([link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/779546v1)).

The methods are Based on the multivariate **topographic analysis**. 

- The first method separates continuous ERP waveforms into distinct components based on their topographic patterns and **reveals the temporal evolution of components**. Crucial temporal indices (peak latency, onset and offset times, processing speed) can be automatically identified. 
- The second method scrutinizes the temporal dynamics of identified components by **reducing the temporal variance among trials**. This method quantifies the temporal variance as a new measure of cognitive noise, as well as increases both the accuracy of temporal dynamics estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ERP responses by aligning trials. 

The validity and reliability of the two methods were **tested with empirical datasets** from an attention study and a semantic priming study, respectively. 

### The Innovations and Discoveries

The first method provides a complete temporal profile and reflects all aspects of neural dynamics. It opens a new dimension in the analysis of non-invasive scalp recordings and pave a new way to test temporal aspects of cognitive neuroscience theories.

The second method quantifies the temporal variance among trials as a new measure of cognitive noise, which is a new perspective into this problem. By aligning single trials, it increases both the accuracy of temporal dynamics estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ERP responses.
