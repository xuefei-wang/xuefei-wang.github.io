### The Problem

Fine **temporal resolution** at millisecond-level grants EEG enormous advantages to probe the underlying neural dynamics of various cognitive functions . However, non-invasive scalp recordings are usually noisy. To improve SNR, neural signals are averaged across trials to reveal relatively stable dynamics. With random noise being averaged out, the remaining waveform is called the **Event-Related Potential** (ERP). One of the common ways to explore the neural dynamics in ERPs is to examine the neural response magnitude around certain peak latencies.

The well-established ERP analysis utilizes only a small portion of the **temporal information** from EEG recordings, namely the peak latencies. More temporal indices can provide a more complete picture of neural dynamics. 

### The Approach

To probe the temporal information in EEG recordings, I developed an analytical framework and implemented a Python-based open source package named [TTT](https://github.com/TTT-EEG/TTT-EEG) (Topography-based Temporal-analysis Toolbox). The manuscript is in submission and the preprint can be found in Biorxiv ([link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/779546v1)).

The methods are Based on the multivariate **topographic analysis**. 

#### Method 1

The first method separates continuous ERP waveforms into distinct components based on their topographic patterns and **reveals the temporal evolution of components**. Crucial temporal indices (peak latency, onset and offset times, processing speed) can be automatically identified.

<span style="color:grey"> *Figure 1. Simulation results of the first method (Temporal evolution of components). (A) The simulated data. The simulated waveform responses were generated using sinusoidal waves with additional Gaussian noise. Black lines in the lower panel represent the raw data of 32 sensors. The red line represents the global field power (GFP), the geometric mean of responses across all sensors. Topographies at selected latencies are depicted in the upper panel, showing the temporal evolution of the component. (B) The similarity matrix. Cosine values are obtained by comparing each pair of topographies (1000 x 1000). The (ith, jth) element of the matrix denotes the degree of pattern similarity between the ith and jth topographies. Principal diagonal line is the auto-correlations of each topography, therefore the values are all ones. High-correlation (green-yellow) clusters along the principal diagonal line reveal the component. (C) Gradient matrix with superimposed GFP waveform. Dark ridges in the gradient matrix represent the cluster boundaries. The GFP waveform is superimposed on the gradient matrix with the red portion represents the pre-selected period of interest (POI) for the detection of a component. The green dots on the GFP label the detected onset and offset time points, corresponding to the ridges in the gradient matrix. The yellow star represents the detected peak latency at the maximum amplitude of the GFP waveform.*</span>

#### Method 2

The second method scrutinizes the temporal dynamics of identified components by **reducing the temporal variance among trials**. This method quantifies the temporal variance as a new measure of cognitive noise, as well as increases both the accuracy of temporal dynamics estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ERP responses by aligning trials.

<span style="color:grey"> *Figure 3: Simulation results of the second method (Precise temporal estimation after reducing temporal variance across trials). A) Two types of simulated trials yield the same averaged waveform. The waveforms represent the GFP of simulated data. The first set of trials are depicted in blue. These trials have a short duration and high temporal variance of peak latencies among trials. The second set of trials is illustrated in orange. These trials have a long duration and low temporal variance of peak latencies among trials. The average of both sets of trials yields the same ERP responses (bold red waveform). A template topography T is selected at the peak latency of the averaged responses. B) Schematic plot of projection for identifying peak latency in single trials. The gray arrow represents the vector of template topography, whereas the blue and orange arrows represent the topographies of a single trial across time from the first and second sets. Each topography at a time point is projected onto the template topography T. The length of the parallel part represents the noise-free response magnitude. The projected values form new waveforms and the new peak latency is identified. C) Distributions of individual trial latencies. Histograms of new peak latencies identified in B) are depicted in corresponding colors (blue for the first set trials and orange for the second set). The normal distribution function is fitted to both histograms. The first set of trials results in a flat and wide distribution (blue, μ=26.09, σ= 8.80). Whereas the second set of trials yields a tall and sharp distribution (orange, μ=28.45, σ= 2.81). D) Averaged ERP responses after aligning trials at new peak latencies. The second set of trials yield an average response that is similar to the original one in A). Whereas the average response of the first set of trials is shorter in duration and higher in amplitude compared with the original. color shaded areas represent +/- standard error of the mean (SEM).*</span>

The validity and reliability of the two methods were **tested with empirical datasets** from an attention study and a semantic priming study, respectively. 

### The Innovations and Discoveries

The first method provides a complete temporal profile and reflects all aspects of neural dynamics. It opens a new dimension in the analysis of non-invasive scalp recordings and pave a new way to test temporal aspects of cognitive neuroscience theories.

The second method quantifies the temporal variance among trials as a new measure of cognitive noise, which is a new perspective into this problem. By aligning single trials, it increases both the accuracy of temporal dynamics estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ERP responses.
