Work: data analysis (multiple single-unit recordings)

Topic: spatial cognition, decision-making, and episodic memory



I worked with Professor [Douglas Nitz](http://dnitz.com/) at UCSD to examine the multiple single-unit recordings as the animals traversed multiple routes within a triple-T maze. We aimed to investigate the generalization property of **Subiculum** (SUB) neurons across different paths.

To examine the information coding of SUB neurons, the difficulty is three-folds: SUB neurons exhibit heterogeneous generalization patterns; there are often more than one place fields for each neuron;  different paths in the maze are too complicated to make simple comparisons. 

I first quantified environment/behavior variables to characterize path differences. I investigated and tried out different methods, and innovatively used the **decision tree**. A tree is constructed for each neuron, assigning credits to different variables to explain the **firing pattern across paths**. It quantified the information encoding at the single-unit level and solved the heterogeneous problem. It worked well on the multiple-place-filed neurons because the tree automatically split and broke 'place' into different pieces. We quantified the abstract ‘analogy’ and attribute it to different **environment variables**. The direct comparison can also be made **across brain regions (CA1, SUB, PPC)** to interpret the information transformation from upstream to downstream.

We are also working to complete an analysis that will track task-phase specific alterations in theta-frequency spike **phase precession** in SUB. Further generalization ability in rate coding and phase coding will be compared.
