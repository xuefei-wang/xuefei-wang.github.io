### The Problem

Subiculum is a major output region of hippocampus. neurons sometimes exhibit place-specific firing akin to that of CA1, yet reported differences include increased generalization of place 
fields across environments. In **open arenas**, the generalization can be expilicitly expressed as scaling of firing fields to match arena size, increased numbers and sizes of fields, and Bounary Vector Cells (BVC). However, in **tracks**, the generalization has not been fully explored. 

In Douglas Nitz's lab, the experiment has been conducted and **axis tuning** neurons have been reported as **one form of generalization** in the context of tracks.

However, it still remains unknown what generalization Subiculum is actually performing, and **what information Subiculum encodes**.

To examine the information coding of SUB neurons, the **difficulty** is three-folds: 

- SUB neurons exhibit heterogeneous generalization patterns; 
- there are often more than one place fields for each neuron;  
- different paths in the maze are too complicated to make simple comparisons. 

### The Approach

Muktiple single-unit recordings were made as the animals traversed multiple routes within a triple-T maze. Iinvestigated the generalization property of Subiculum neurons across different paths. 

I first quantified environment/behavior variables to characterize path differences. I investigated and tried out different methods, and innovatively used the **decision tree**. A tree is constructed for each neuron. All data points are assigned to the root node, and represented by a single mean value. The node is recursively divided into children nodes, so that more **variability** is explained. The split is based on the current most informative variable. We search the best parameter for number of splits.   assigning credits to different variables to explain the firing pattern across paths. 

We are also working to complete an analysis that will track task-phase specific alterations in theta-frequency spike **phase precession** in SUB. Further generalization ability in rate coding and phase coding will be compared.

### The Innovations and Discoveries

This analysis tackled the abovementioned three-fold difficulty:

- The anaysis quantified the information encoding at the single-unit level and solved the heterogeneous problem. 

- It worked well on the multiple-place-filed neurons because the tree automatically split and broke 'place' into different pieces. 

- We quantified the abstract ‘analogy’ and attribute it to different **environment variables** (selected by decision tree), and the differences among different paths were broken down to these environment variables. In this way, we could compare between paths.

Moreover, direct comparison was made **across brain regions (CA1, SUB, PPC)** to interpret the information transformation from upstream to downstream.
