# Entrainment

 The word comes from *complex system*. The synchrony of two or more independent oscillator.

autonomous oscillators with differing rhythms or frequencies, when situated in a context and at a proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on coupling force, such that they adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency.

In neuroscience, it usually refers to the synchrony between brain oscillation and an external oscillation.

> Precise alignment of neural oscillations with rhythmic stimuli is accomplished via entrainment, which is a process by which two oscillations become synchronized, or phase-locked, through **phase and/or period adjustments**
