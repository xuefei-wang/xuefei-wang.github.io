# Neural Oscillation

## 同步现象

同步（到底是什么层面上的同步？脑区之间还是某一层？局部？）

对单个神经元来说：可以是spikes，也可以是membrane potential(under threshold)

对ensemble来说：macroscopic oscillation，例如alpha wave。local field potential

可以是更大规模的：比如EEG记录到的数据







## independent of stimulation

不需要外部刺激

刺激可以modulate：

- reset the phase

- change magnitude



## Dendritic

stimuli that occur in the ideal **excitability phase** of slow oscillations (< 12 Hz, delta-theta band) are processed faster and with a higher accuracy (Lakatos et al., 2008; Busch et al., 2009; Henry and Obleser, 2012; Ng et al., 2012; Wyart et al., 2012).

TODO bass sound - biomusicology(?

Gamma band (40-Hz) can be observed in resting states. - endogenous

> This gamma activity is thought to be generated by a “ping-pong” interaction between pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons (Borgers et al., 2005, 2008), or even just among interneurons that are located in superficial cortical layers (Tiesinga and Sejnowski, 2009). 



## Function

feature binding

information transfer mechanism

generation of rhythmic motor output







encoding and retrieval of memories have been hypothesized to occur on opposite phases of theta oscillations
