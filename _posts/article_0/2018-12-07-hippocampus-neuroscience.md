## Hippocampus 

- route modified encoding of environmental position

​	place

​	trajectory/episode

## Subiculum 

- encoding of environmental position, current axis of travel, analogous components of route spaces

​	place

​	analogy

​	axis 9%

​		track: present

​		free-forging: absent

​		carry environmental space as their frame of reference

​	direction

​	boundary vector cells





## Retrosplenial Cortex 

- encoding of conjunctions between route position, position of route in environment, current action, route sub-spaces, distance (???????)

​	position in route???

​	position in environment?? 

​	position in sub-space???

​	target location???

​	distance??

​	head direction???

## Posterior Parietal Cortex 

- environment-independent encoding of route position, hierarchical relationship between route sub-components, current action

​	position in route???

​	turning action(left v.s. right)

​	target position??

​	position in sub-space?

## Medial Precentral 

premotor? motor?

​	current action

​	planned action





## CA1

place cells, direction(external cue > internal cue)

> EXPERIENCE BASED (jEFFERY MAGEE, BSTP)

## CA3



# Memory

## Entorhinal Cortex

grid cells

compressed of information





## Dentate Gyrus

one of the few regions that have neurogenesis(产生新神经元)

### Three layers

- molecular
- granular 
- polymorphic



### Neurons

Granule cells: 

- output: mossy fibers, excitatory connections to CA3 pyramid cells
- input: perforant pathway from Entorhinal Cortex layer 2
  - medial: proximal dendritic areas of dentate gyrus 
  - lateral: distal 

Mossy cells:

- output: 



### Function

pattern separation and form new memory(sparse)

可以reverse valence (Bidirectional switch of the valence associated with a hippocampal contextual memory engram)

## CA3

memory retrieval





## CA1

proximal - close to CA3

distal - far from CA3
