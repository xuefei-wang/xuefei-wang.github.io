# Thoughts on Failure of Blue Brain Project

20190909

I'm a believer of **bottom-up** strategy. I don't think the pure construction of a functional representation is useful, or any closer to the truth.

I thought Blue Brain Project might be a good idea, at least to **reconcile** all findings.

But it turned out as a failure (or at least, it does not reach the one-decade-human-brain-simulation goal; or the media take a negative view on it now).



> Even if that simulation shows properties like intelligence, it will be difficult to understand where those came from. It wonâ€™t be a simple matter of tweaking one part of the simulation and seeing what happens. If you are trying to understand the brain and you do a really good simulation, the problem is that you end up with... the brain. And the brain is very **complicated**.
