# Brainwave Entrainment

the practice of entraining one's brainwaves to a desired frequency

同步

这个词来源于复杂系统complex system，表示两个oscillator之间的同步 two or more independent, autonomous oscillators with differing rhythms or frequencies, when situated in a context and at a proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on coupling force, such that they adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency.

对于神经科学来说，就是让脑活动和外界一个刺激的频率同步

Precise alignment of neural oscillations with rhythmic stimuli is accomplished via entrainment, which is a process by which two oscillations become synchronized, or phase-locked, through **phase and/or period adjustments**
