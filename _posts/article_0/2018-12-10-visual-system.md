# Visual Cortex

## V1

primary visual cortex/striate cortex

6 layers

layer 4 receives input from LGN

retinotopic mapping with cortical magnification(fovea 附近对应的脑区面积更大)

early: strong tuning to a small set of stimuli, cortical columns: similar tuning properties

later(100ms+): sensitive to global organization(probably from feedback processing like V4, IT, MT [extra-classical receptive field])

edge is more important than area

## V2

secondary visual cortex/prestriate cortex

belong to the visual association area

tuned to simple properties like orientation, spatial frequency, color, and modulated by more complex properties, like the orientation of illusory contour, binocular disparity, figure-ground...

might play an important role in ventral visual-to-hippocampal stream



## V3

dorsal V3, strong connection with V1, V2, part of dorsal stream, project to Posterior Parietal Cortex, process global motion(some prefer it to be part of a larger area, named the Dorsomedial Area, respond to coherent motion)

ventral V3, weaker connection with V1, stronger connection with inferior temporal cortex







## V4

in the ventral stream, receive strong feedforward connection from V2, receives direct input from V1, especially for central space. send strong connection to PIT.

strong attention modulation, tuned for orientation, spatial frequency and color. tuned for object features of intermediate complexity, like simple geometric shapes; not tuned for complex objects like faces.

long-term plasticity, encode stimuli salience, gated by signals coming from frontal eye field



## V5

MT, Middle Temporal Visual Area

direction-selective neurons, perception of motion, the integration of local motion signals into global percepts, the guidance of eye movements

input from V1, V2, dorsal V3, the koniocellular region of LGN, inferior pulvinar.

(some information might reach MT before it reaches V1)

output: FST, MST, V4t





## V6

visual stimuli assocaited with self-motion, wide-field stimulation
