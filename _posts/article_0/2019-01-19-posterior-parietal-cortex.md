# Posterior Parietal Cortex



common frame work of reference: eye-centered

gain field(modulation of retinotopic fields by eye/head/body/limb position signals): transforming between coordinate frames

attention - neglect



MIP:

- priority map
- transform sensory into decision



> - map reflecting relevance(priority) of stimuli
> - transforming sensory evidence into decision, code the direction of stimulus rather than movement
> - reaching

 - 

PRR:

(include MIP)

- reach planning



LIP:





- saccade planning
- accumulate sensory signals 
- code the direction of stimulus rather than movement, some cell code both??
- another paper says it encodes the choice



AIP:

- grasping



MST:

- smooth-pursuit
- 





> **distinguish intention from attention:**
>
> intention: movement planning/ preparation
>
> attention: cue/ stimulus,
>
> ??but to my understanding. attention is a more general term, which includes the time period when I want to take some movements



Sensory History: 

> find long-term regularities and exploit them
