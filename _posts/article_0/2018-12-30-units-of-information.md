# Units of Information



1 nibble = 4 bits

1 byte = 2 nibbles = 8 bits

1 word = The natural size with which a processor is handling data (the register size). 

> "Word size" refers to the number of bits processed by a computer's CPU in one go (these days, typically 32 bits or 64 bits). Data bus size, instruction size, address size are usually multiples of the word size.
>
> Just to confuse matters, for backwards compatibility, Microsoft Windows API defines a WORD as being 16 bits, a DWORD as 32 bits and a QWORD as 64 bits, regardless of the processor.
