difference between **Simulator** and **Emulator**

You want to duplicate the behavior of an old HP calculator, there are two options:

1. You write new program that draws the calculator's display and keys, and when the user clicks on the keys, your programs does what the old calculator did. This is a *Simulator*
2. You get a dump of the calculator's firmware, then write a program that loads the firmware and interprets it the same way the microprocessor in the calculator did. This is an *Emulator*

The *Simulator* tries to duplicate the *behavior* of the device.
The *Emulator* tries to duplicate the *inner workings* of the device.
