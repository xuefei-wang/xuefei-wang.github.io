I"ö<p>difference between <strong>Simulator</strong> and <strong>Emulator</strong></p>

<p>You want to duplicate the behavior of an old HP calculator, there are two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You write new program that draws the calculatorâ€™s display and keys, and when the user clicks on the keys, your programs does what the old calculator did. This is a <em>Simulator</em></li>
  <li>You get a dump of the calculatorâ€™s firmware, then write a program that loads the firmware and interprets it the same way the microprocessor in the calculator did. This is an <em>Emulator</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The <em>Simulator</em> tries to duplicate the <em>behavior</em> of the device.
The <em>Emulator</em> tries to duplicate the <em>inner workings</em> of the device.</p>
