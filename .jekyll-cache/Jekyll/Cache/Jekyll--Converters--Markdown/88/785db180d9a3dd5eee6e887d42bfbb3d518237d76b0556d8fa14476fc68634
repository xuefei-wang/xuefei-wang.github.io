<h2 id="v1">V1</h2>

<p>primary visual cortex/striate cortex</p>

<p>6 layers</p>

<p>layer 4 receives input from LGN</p>

<p>retinotopic mapping with cortical magnification(fovea ÈôÑËøëÂØπÂ∫îÁöÑËÑëÂå∫Èù¢ÁßØÊõ¥Â§ß)</p>

<p>early: strong tuning to a small set of stimuli, cortical columns: similar tuning properties</p>

<p>later(100ms+): sensitive to global organization(probably from feedback processing like V4, IT, MT [extra-classical receptive field])</p>

<p>edge is more important than area</p>

<h2 id="v2">V2</h2>

<p>secondary visual cortex/prestriate cortex</p>

<p>belong to the visual association area</p>

<p>tuned to simple properties like orientation, spatial frequency, color, and modulated by more complex properties, like the orientation of illusory contour, binocular disparity, figure-ground‚Ä¶</p>

<p>might play an important role in ventral visual-to-hippocampal stream</p>

<h2 id="v3">V3</h2>

<p>dorsal V3, strong connection with V1, V2, part of dorsal stream, project to Posterior Parietal Cortex, process global motion(some prefer it to be part of a larger area, named the Dorsomedial Area, respond to coherent motion)</p>

<p>ventral V3, weaker connection with V1, stronger connection with inferior temporal cortex</p>

<h2 id="v4">V4</h2>

<p>in the ventral stream, receive strong feedforward connection from V2, receives direct input from V1, especially for central space. send strong connection to PIT.</p>

<p>strong attention modulation, tuned for orientation, spatial frequency and color. tuned for object features of intermediate complexity, like simple geometric shapes; not tuned for complex objects like faces.</p>

<p>long-term plasticity, encode stimuli salience, gated by signals coming from frontal eye field</p>

<h2 id="v5">V5</h2>

<p>MT, Middle Temporal Visual Area</p>

<p>direction-selective neurons, perception of motion, the integration of local motion signals into global percepts, the guidance of eye movements</p>

<p>input from V1, V2, dorsal V3, the koniocellular region of LGN, inferior pulvinar.</p>

<p>(some information might reach MT before it reaches V1)</p>

<p>output: FST, MST, V4t</p>

<h2 id="v6">V6</h2>

<p>visual stimuli assocaited with self-motion, wide-field stimulation</p>
