<p>the practice of entraining one’s brainwaves to a desired frequency</p>

<p>同步</p>

<p>这个词来源于复杂系统complex system，表示两个oscillator之间的同步 two or more independent, autonomous oscillators with differing rhythms or frequencies, when situated in a context and at a proximity where they can interact for long enough, influence each other mutually, to a degree dependent on coupling force, such that they adjust until both oscillate with the same frequency.</p>

<p>对于神经科学来说，就是让脑活动和外界一个刺激的频率同步</p>

<p>Precise alignment of neural oscillations with rhythmic stimuli is accomplished via entrainment, which is a process by which two oscillations become synchronized, or phase-locked, through <strong>phase and/or period adjustments</strong></p>
