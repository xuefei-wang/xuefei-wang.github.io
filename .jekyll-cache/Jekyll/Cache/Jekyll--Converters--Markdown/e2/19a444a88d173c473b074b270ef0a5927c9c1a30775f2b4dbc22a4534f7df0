<p>used for hypothesis testing</p>

<p>就是看一看，两个group是不是有区别</p>

<p>把两个group的label randomize一下</p>

<p>The advantage of the randomization test is that it doesn’t require that we assume that the data from each of the groups are normally distributed, though the t-test is generally quite robust to violations of that assumption. In addition, the randomization test can allow us to compute p-values for statistics when we don’t have a theoretical distribution like we do for the t-test.</p>

<p>We do have to make one main assumption when we use the randomization test, which we refer to as <em>exchangeability</em>. This means that all of the observations are distributed in the same way, such that we can interchange them without changing the overall distribution. The main place where this can break down is when there are related observations in the data; for example, if we had data from individuals in 4 different families, then we couldn’t assume that individuals were exchangeable, because siblings would be closer to each other than they are to individuals from other families. In general, if the data were obtained by random sampling, then the assumption of exchangeability should hold.</p>
