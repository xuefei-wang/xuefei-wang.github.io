<p>Work: data analysis (multiple single-unit recordings)</p>

<p>Topic: spatial cognition, decision-making, and episodic memory</p>

<p>I worked with Professor <a href="http://dnitz.com/">Douglas Nitz</a> at UCSD to examine the multiple single-unit recordings as the animals traversed multiple routes within a triple-T maze. We aimed to investigate the generalization property of <strong>Subiculum</strong> (SUB) neurons across different paths.</p>

<p>To examine the information coding of SUB neurons, the difficulty is three-folds: SUB neurons exhibit heterogeneous generalization patterns; there are often more than one place fields for each neuron;  different paths in the maze are too complicated to make simple comparisons.</p>

<p>I first quantified environment/behavior variables to characterize path differences. I investigated and tried out different methods, and innovatively used the <strong>decision tree</strong>. A tree is constructed for each neuron, assigning credits to different variables to explain the <strong>firing pattern across paths</strong>. It quantified the information encoding at the single-unit level and solved the heterogeneous problem. It worked well on the multiple-place-filed neurons because the tree automatically split and broke ‘place’ into different pieces. We quantified the abstract ‘analogy’ and attribute it to different <strong>environment variables</strong>. The direct comparison can also be made <strong>across brain regions (CA1, SUB, PPC)</strong> to interpret the information transformation from upstream to downstream.</p>

<p>We are also working to complete an analysis that will track task-phase specific alterations in theta-frequency spike <strong>phase precession</strong> in SUB. Further generalization ability in rate coding and phase coding will be compared.</p>
