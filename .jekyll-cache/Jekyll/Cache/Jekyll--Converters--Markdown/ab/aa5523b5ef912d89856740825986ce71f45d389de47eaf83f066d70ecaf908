I""<p>Work: develop FPGA-based sound generator module</p>

<p>Topic:</p>

<p>I’m working to complete an <strong>FPFA</strong>-based Sound Generator System. Response time of a cue delivering system is crucial in research, especially neural activity is recorded. However, a typical PC-based system usually suffers from a 20ms delay unless expensive commercial equipment is employed. One solution is to use DDS chips, but it limits the waveform to be only sinusoid-based.</p>

<p>Hoping for the flexibility of delivering arbitrary sounds, I decided to customize an FPGA design. It’s especially complicated to code for a memory interface controller. As a novice, I dived into the technical datasheets, studied protocols, tested each part many times, and finally pushed to a successful version. The system consists of an FPGA development board with a DDR3 SDRAM for data storage, a USB interface to communicate with the PC host. Output signals are sent to a DAC chip and an amplifier. The system is reliable and flexible – It ensures the minimal response delay and allows for any arbitrary waveforms. It opens up many possibilities for further experiment design.</p>

<p>The project is still in development, and the <a href="https://github.com/xuefei-wang/sound-generator-module">code</a> can be found in Github</p>
