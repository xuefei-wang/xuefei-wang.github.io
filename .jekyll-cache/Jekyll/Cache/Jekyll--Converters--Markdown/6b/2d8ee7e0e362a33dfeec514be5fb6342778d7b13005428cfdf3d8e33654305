I"ï<p>Work: rabies tracing</p>

<p>Topic: brain-wide input connection, auditory cortex, projection-specific, Cortical-Cortical, Cortical-Subcortical</p>

<p>We studied the subgroup of auditory neurons found they are differently involved in perception and choice in 2AFC tasks, specifically <strong>Cortical â€“ Cortical (CC)</strong> projecting neurons are more involved in sensory information processing, while <strong>Cortical â€“ Subcortical (CS)</strong> projecting neurons are more related with choice information. Therefore, we wonder if the difference could be attributed to the input pattern differences.</p>

<p>I performed rabies tracing on the two subpopulations. For CS neurons, wildtype animals are used. Cav-cre, AAV-Flex-mCherry-TVA-2A-G are injected in superior colliculus, auditory cortex, respectively. Two weeks later, Rabies-dG-GFP-EnvA was injected in the same site in Auditory Cortex. For the first time, I took the courage to leave the comfort zone of â€˜dry labsâ€™, and got my hands â€˜wetâ€™. To perform the tracing, multiple injections were required for every single animal, therefore the surgery was more prone to failures. I succeeded in collecting data from 12 mice. Preliminary result dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) neurons project more to CC neurons, while input from cingulate/retrosplenial cortex(Cg/RS) neurons is more received by CS neurons. The difference in anatomy may help explain their difference in information coding and functionality in sensory-choice 2AFC tasks.</p>
