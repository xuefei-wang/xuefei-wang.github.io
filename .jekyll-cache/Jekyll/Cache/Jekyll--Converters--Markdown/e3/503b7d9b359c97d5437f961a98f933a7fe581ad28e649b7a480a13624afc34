<p>Work: develop method, implement as Python package</p>

<p>Topic: ERP, temporal analysis,</p>

<p>The fine <strong>temporal resolution</strong> of  EEG should give rich temporal information. But the information is submerged by <strong>noise</strong>. If it can be extracted and utilized, a complete profile of neural dynamics can be provided.</p>

<p>Based on the multivariate <strong>topographic</strong> analysis, I developed an analytical framework to explore neural dynamics in ERPs. The first method separates continuous ERP waveforms into distinct components based on their topographic patterns. Crucial <strong>temporal indices</strong> (peak latency, onset and offset times, processing speed) can be automatically identified. The second method scrutinizes the temporal dynamics of identified components by <strong>reducing the temporal variance among trials</strong>. This method quantifies the temporal variance as a new measure of cognitive noise, as well as increases both the accuracy of temporal dynamics estimation and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the ERP responses by aligning trials.</p>

<p>The validity and reliability of these methods were <strong>tested with empirical datasets</strong> from an attention study and a semantic priming study.</p>

<p>These methods are implemented in the Python-based open-source package <a href="https://github.com/TTT-EEG/TTT-EEG">TTT</a> (Topography-based Temporal-analysis Toolbox). The <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/779546v1">manuscript</a> can be found in Biorxiv.</p>
