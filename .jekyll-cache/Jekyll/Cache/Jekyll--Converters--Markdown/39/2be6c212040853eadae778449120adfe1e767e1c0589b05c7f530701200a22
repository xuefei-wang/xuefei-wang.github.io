<p>20190909</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a believer of <strong>bottom-up</strong> strategy. I donâ€™t think the pure construction of a functional representation is useful, or any closer to the truth.</p>

<p>I thought Blue Brain Project might be a good idea, at least to <strong>reconcile</strong> all findings.</p>

<p>But it turned out as a failure (or at least, it does not reach the one-decade-human-brain-simulation goal; or the media take a negative view on it now).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Even if that simulation shows properties like intelligence, it will be difficult to understand where those came from. It wonâ€™t be a simple matter of tweaking one part of the simulation and seeing what happens. If you are trying to understand the brain and you do a really good simulation, the problem is that you end up withâ€¦ the brain. And the brain is very <strong>complicated</strong>.</p>

  <p>That putting them together gets you emergent function <strong>disembodied from experience</strong></p>
